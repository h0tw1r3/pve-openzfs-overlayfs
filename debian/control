Description: wrapper for libzfs_core C library
 libzfs_core is intended to be a stable interface for programmatic
 administration of ZFS. This wrapper provides one-to-one wrappers for
 libzfs_core API functions, but the signatures and types are more natural to
 Python.
 .
 nvlists are wrapped as dictionaries or lists depending on their usage.
 Some parameters have default values depending on typical use for
 increased convenience. Enumerations and bit flags become strings and lists
 of strings in Python. Errors are reported as exceptions rather than integer
 errno-style error codes.  The wrapper takes care to provide one-to-many
 mapping of the error codes to the exceptions by interpreting a context
 in which the error code is produced.

Description: Solaris Porting Layer user-space utilities for Linux (dummy)
 The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which provides
 many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes it possible to
 run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with relatively minimal
 modification. The Solaris Porting LAyer Tests (SPLAT) is a Linux kernel
 module which provides a testing harness for the SPL module.
 .
 SPL can be particularly useful when you want to track upstream Illumos
 (or any other OpenSolaris fork) development closely and don't want the
 overhead of maintaining a large patch which converts Solaris primitives
 to Linux primitives.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package. It can safely be removed.
